The method is based on the hierarchical quantum master equation approach and uses a discrete variable representation of the nuclear degrees of freedom in combination with complex absorbing potentials and an auxiliary source term. It provides numerically exact results for a range of models. By taking the coupling to the continuum of electronic states of the surface properly into account, nonadiabatic processes can be described and the effect of electronic friction is included in a nonperturbative and non-Markovian way. Illustrative applications to models for desorption of a molecule at a surface and the current-induced bond rupture in single-molecule junctions demonstrate the performance and versatility of the method.},

  abstract = {The chemisorption of a hydrogen atom on a transition-metal surface is treated theoretically on the basis of the Anderson Hamiltonian in Hartree-Fock approximation, which includes the interelectronic interaction within the 1⁢𝑠 orbital. One-electron theory is shown to be inadequate for this problem. The localized states which may occur are discussed. A simple expression for the chemisorption energy 𝛥⁢𝐸 is obtained, and a variational method is given for obtaining its self-consistent value. The metal eigenfunctions enter 𝛥⁢𝐸 only through a function 𝛥⁡(𝜀), and the foregoing results are exemplified and applied when this function is semielliptical. When the band is half-filled, a single analytic formula for the one-electron part of 𝛥⁢𝐸 is obtained, in accord with the Kohn-Majumdar theorem. With some further assumptions, 𝛥⁢𝐸 and the charge on the atom are calculated for adsorption on Ti, Cr, Ni, and Cu. The values of the hopping integral between the 1⁢𝑠 orbital and a neighboring metal 𝑑 orbital required to fit the experimental 𝛥⁢𝐸 are found to be similar and are reasonable. The correct prediction that |𝛥⁢𝐸|Ni {$>$}|𝛥⁢𝐸|Cu is believed to be significant. A suggestive correlation is found between observations of catalytic ortho-para hydrogen interconversion on Pd-Au alloys and a rigidband calculation of 𝛥⁢𝐸.},

  abstract = {The conditions necessary in metals for the presence or absence of localized moments on solute ions containing inner shell electrons are analyzed. A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the 𝑠 −𝑑 admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the 𝑑 shell; that in the magnetic state the 𝑑 polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized 𝑑 level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in 𝑑-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate 𝑑 orbitals and 𝑑 −𝑑 exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

In this paper, we propose an independent-electron surface hopping algorithm for the simulation of nonadiabatic gas-surface dynamics. The transfer of energy to electron-hole pair excitations of the metal is successfully captured by hops between electronic adiabats. The algorithm is able to account for the creation of multiple electron-hole pairs in the metal due to nonadiabatic transitions. Detailed simulations of the vibrational relaxation of nitric oxide on a gold surface, employing a multistate potential energy surface fit to density functional theory calculations, confirm that our algorithm can capture the underlying physics of the inelastic scattering process.},

It is capable of modeling the nonadiabatic effects of electron–hole pair excitations on molecular dynamics. Here, we present a transparent, reliable, and efficient implementation of IESH, demonstrating its ability to predict scattering and desorption probabilities across a variety of systems, ranging from model Hamiltonians to full dimensional atomistic systems. We further show how the algorithm can be modified to account for the application of an external bias potential, comparing its accuracy to results obtained using the hierarchical quantum master equation. Our results show that IESH is a practical method for modeling coupled electron-nuclear dynamics at metal surfaces, especially for highly energetic scattering events.},
