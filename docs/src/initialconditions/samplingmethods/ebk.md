# [Semiclassical EBK quantisation](@id ebk-sampling)

In surface science, it is often of interest to investigate how collisions with surfaces
can perturb the quantum states of molecules.
In particular, for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers
can undergo significant changes when the molecule impacts the surface.

Einstein-Brillouinn-Keller (EBK) quantisation allows for a semiclassical investigation
into these phenomena by providing a link between the quantum numbers and classical
positions and velocities.
The quantisation procedure allows the user to generate a classical distribution
with a given set of quantum numbers, then perform semiclassical dynamics
and extract the quantum numbers at the end by reversing the procedure.

These three steps can be applied to give insight into the processes taking place
during surface scattering and allow us to attempt to predict the experimentally
observed change in the quantum numbers.

A detailed yet approachable description of the theory is given by [Larkoski2006](@cite)
so we shall not delve into the theory here.
Briefly, the procedure for a diatomic molecule involves an optimisation process to
find the bounds of an integral, then computing the integral to obtain the vibrational
quantum number.
The rotational quantum number comes directly from the classical angular momentum
of the molecule.

Configurations can be generated by randomly selecting bond lengths from the appropriate
probability distribution and selecting a matching radial velocity.
