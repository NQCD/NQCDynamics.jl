# [Electronic friction models](@id models-friction)

To perform [molecular dynamics with electronic friction (MDEF)](@ref mdef-dynamics)
a specific type of model must be used
that provides the friction tensor used to propagate the dynamics.

As detailed in the [MDEF page](@ref mdef-dynamics), there are two ways to obtain friction
values, either from the local density friction approximation (LDFA), or from time-dependent
perturbation theory (TDPT).
The models on this page describe our existing implementations.

## Analytic models

Since *ab initio* friction calculations are often expensive it is useful to
have some models that we can use to test different friction methods.
The [`DiabaticFrictionModel`](@ref NonadiabaticModels.DiabaticModels.DiabaticFrictionModel)
is the abstract type that groups together the diabatic models for which electronic friction can be evaluated.
These have many electronic states, modelling the electronic structure characteristic of a metal. 
The friction is calculated for these models directly from the nonadiabatic couplings
with the equation:
```math
Î³ = 2\pi\hbar \sum_j <1|dH|j><j|dH|1> \delta(\omega_j) / \omega_j
```
where the delta function is approximated by a normalised Gaussian function and the sum
runs over the adiabatic states ([Box2021](@cite)).
The matrix elements in this equation are the position derivatives of the diabatic hamiltonian
converted to the adiabatic representation.

    The analytic friction models and the equation above are experimental and subject to change.

## [CubeLDFAModel.jl](@id models-cubeldfa)

Our LDFA implementation is given in
[CubeLDFAModel.jl](https://github.com/NQCD/CubeLDFAModel.jl)
which takes a `.cube` file containing the electron density and evaluates the friction based
upon this local density.

The model works by fitting the LDA data provided by [Gerrits2020](@cite) that provides
the LDFA friction coefficient as a function of the Wigner-Seitz radius.
When the model is initialised, the LDA data from [Gerrits2020](@cite) is interpolated
using [DataInterpolations.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/DataInterpolations.jl)
with a cubic spline.
Then, whenever required, the density at the current position is taken directly from the
`.cube` file and converted to the Wigner-Seitz radius with the following relation:
```math
r_s(\rho) = (\frac{3}{4\pi \rho (\mathbf{r_{i}})})^{1/3}.
```
Then, the interpolation function is evaluated with this value for the radius, which gives
the LDA friction.
Optimally, this would be done via an *ab initio* calculation to get the electron density,
but this model instead uses a pre-computed `.cube` file to get the density with minimal cost.
This makes the assumption that the density does not change throughout the dynamics, or that
the surface is assumed to be frozen in place.

This graph shows how we interpolate the LDA data and evaluate the friction coefficient
as a function of the Wigner-Seitz radius.

The [reactive scattering example](@ref example-h2scattering) uses this model to investigate
the scattering of a diatomic molecule from a metal surface.

## NNInterfaces.jl

Another way to perform MDEF simulations is the use one of the models from
[`NNInterfaces.jl`](https://github.com/NQCD/NNInterfaces.jl/) that uses a neural network
to obtain the time-dependent perturbation theory friction from the atomic positions.
As with LDFA, one of these models is used in the
[reactive scattering example](@ref example-h2scattering).
