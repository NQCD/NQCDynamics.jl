# [Independent electron surface hopping (IESH)](@id iesh-dynamics)

Independent electron surface hopping (IESH) is an extension of Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) [Tully1990](@cite) that
describes a single particle (single electronic state) interacting with a metal, represented as a bath of electronic states.

IESH is classified as a mixed-quantum classical method, where the nuclei are treated classically and the electrons are treated quantum mechanically. Like FSSH and other such surface hopping methods, the nuclei evolve on a single adiabatic potential energy surface at any given moment. At each timestep, a hopping probability is evaluated. If the hopping probability is larger than a uniform random number between 0 and 1, the active state is switched and the adiabatic propagation continues on the new electronic state.
When this algorithm is applied to an ensemble of trajectories, the discrete adiabatic state populations approximate the quantum mechanical populations for each state.

The key difference with IESH comes from the assumption that electrons in the systems are independent. This allows:
 1. the many-electron Hamiltonian of the system to be decomposed into a sum of single electron Hamiltonians ``\hat{H}_{el}^{1}(\mathbf{q})``,
 2. the many-electron wavefunction ``\ket{\Psi}`` can be fomrulated as a single slater determinant ``\ket{\psi_{1} \psi_{2} ... \psi_{N_{e}}}``


The IESH classical Hamiltonian can be written as
```math
H_{\textrm{IESH}}(\mathbf{q}(t), \mathbf{p}) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N} \frac{p_{\alpha}^{2}}{2m_{\alpha}} + U_{0}(\mathbf{q}_{\alpha}(t)) + \sum_{k \in \mathbf{s}(t)} \lambda_{k} (\mathbf{q}_{\alpha}(t))
```
where ``\mathbf{p}`` is the vector of momenta, ``\mathbf{q}`` the positions and ``|\alpha`` denotes the nuclear degree of freedom.
``\mathbf{s}(t)`` is a binary vector that indicates the currently occupied adiabatic electronic states as a function of time
As such, this Hamiltonian describes classical dynamics that proceeds under the influence
of the model's ground state potential ``U_{0}(\mathbf{q}_{\alpha}(t))``, adjusted by the sum of the eigenvalues of ``\hat{H}_{el}^{1}(\mathbf{q})`` to corresponding to occupied electronic states given in ``s(t)``.

Similarly to FSSH, ``s(t)`` must be obtained as the dynamics progress since it itself is time dependent. Again, this is achieved stochastically for each trajectory by making probabilistic hops between surfaces.
The probabilities for making successful hops are obtained by integrating the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation alongside the dynamics as
```math
i \hbar \dot{c}_{k}^{l}(t) = \lambda_{k}(\mathbf{q}(t))c_{k}^{l}(t) - i \hbar \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N}\sum_{j \neq k} \frac{p_{\alpha}}{m_{\alpha}} d_{\alpha,jk}(\mathbf{q}(t)) c_{j}^{l}(t)
```
In this equation, ``c_{k}^{l}(t)`` are the time dependent expansion coefficients for state ``k`` and electron ``l``.
``\mathbf{d}_{\alpha,jk}`` is the nonadiabatic coupling between adiabatic states ``j`` and ``k``.
The hopping probability (which corresponds to replacing index ``k`` in ``s(t)`` with ``j``) is calculated as
```math
g_{k \to j} = \textrm{max}\left( \frac{B_{jk} \Delta t}{A_{kk}}, 0 \right)
```
Where
```math
\begin{align*}
    B_{jk} &= -2 \textrm{Re} (A_{kj}^{*}) \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N} \frac{p_{\alpha}}{m_{\alpha}} d_{\alpha,jk}\\
    A_{kj} &= \braket{\mathbf{k}|\psi} \braket{\psi | \mathbf{j}}  
\end{align*}
```
At each timestep, a uniform random number between 0 and 1 is generated which is compared to the calculated probabilities. If the probability is higher than the random number, then a hop is attempted.

In addition, after a hopping event is selected to occur, the velocity needs to be rescaled in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector. A selected hop will only be successful when there is sufficient kinetic energy for the rescaling such that energy is conserved after the hop.

If there is insufficient kinetic energy, this is termed a frustrated hop, and the dynamics proceeds without performing a hop. When a hop is successful, the kinetic energy is adjusted and the occupation vector ``s(t + \Delta t)`` is modified to reflect the change in state occupation.

## Algorithm

1. Integrate classical dynamics for one timestep
2. Integrate electronic dynamics for one timestep
3. Evaluate hopping probability
4. Perform hop if sufficient probability and kinetic energy
5. Rescale velocity if hop is performed
6. Return to step 1

!!! note

    With `DifferentialEquations.jl` we use a callback to perform the surface hopping
    procedure such that steps 1 and 2 are performed by the DifferentialEquations solvers and steps 3, 4, 5 are
    performed by the callback.

## Interfacing with the `AndersonHolstein` model

The Newns-Anderson or Anderson-Holstein model is a commonly used impurity model which has many applications to surface systems where one wants to simulate an absorbate molecule interacting with a surface. This model works well with the IESH method due to presence of an the explicit bath. 

As such, the IESH single electron Hamiltonian within the framework of the Newns-Anderson model can be written as
```math
    \hat{H}_{el}^{1}(\mathbf{q}) = h(\mathbf{q})\ket{d}\bra{d} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} \epsilon_{k} \ket{k}\bra{k} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} V_{k}(\mathbf{q})\left( \ket{k}\bra{d} + \ket{d}\bra{k} \right)
```
Where ``ket{d}`` and ``ket{k}`` are the single electron states, ``\ket{\psi_{l}}`` acted upon by the creation operators for an electron in the absorbate state (``\hat{d}``) and ``k^\textrm{th}`` bath state (``\hat{c}_{k}^{\dagger}``) respectively.
``h(\mathbf{q})`` is the difference in energy between the absorbate ground and and excited state (``U_{1}(\mathbf{q}) - U_{0}\mathbf{q}``), ``\epsilon_{k}`` is the energy contribution from the ``k^\textrm{th}`` bath state, and ``V_{k}(\mathbf{q})`` is the coupling strength between the ``k^\textrm{th}`` bath state and the absorbate state.

More details of the Newns-Anderson model and it's implementation within NQCD is provided [here](../../NQCModels/systembathmodels.md).

## Example

In this section we can investigate the results obtained for a single trajectory using IESH.

First, the simulation parameters are created. Here, we have a single atom with a mass of
`2000` a.u. and we are using Tully's third model ([Tully1990](@cite)), provided by [NQCModels.jl](@ref).
```@example fssh
using Random; Random.seed!(10) # hide
using NQCDynamics

atoms = Atoms(2000)
sim = Simulation{FSSH}(atoms, TullyModelThree())
```

The [`DynamicsVariables`](@ref) constructor has some extra arguments for FSSH.
The first three match the classical case, but we also provide the initial state and
whether we want this state to be `Adiabatic()` or `Diabatic()`.
The type of state can be important when considering the ordering of the states.
The adiabatic states are always arranged from lowest to highest energy, whereas the diabatic
states will be ordered as defined in the model.
You can inspect the fields of `u` to ensure the initialisation has proceeded as you intend.
```@example fssh
u = DynamicsVariables(sim, [20/2000;;], [-10.;;], PureState(1, Adiabatic()))
```

Finally, the trajectory can be run by passing all the parameters we have set up so far.
Here, we request both the `OutputDiscreteState` output which is equal to ``s(t)`` and 
`OutputDiabaticPopulation`, which gives us the population of each diabatic state along the trajectory.
```@example fssh
traj = run_dynamics(sim, (0.0, 2000.0), u, output=(OutputDiscreteState, OutputDiabaticPopulation))
```

Now we can plot ``s(t)`` throughout the trajectory. The FSSH algorithm attempts to minimise
the total number of hops; in the limit of infinite hops the result would tend to the
mean-field (Ehrenfest) result, which is what FSSH attempts to avoid.
```@example fssh
using Plots
plot(traj, :OutputDiscreteState)
```

Similarly, we can plot the diabatic populations. Since FSSH is performed in the adiabatic
representation, even in the case of few hops, the diabatic populations can look dramatically
different depending on the complexity of the model Hamiltonian. 
```@example fssh
plot(traj, :OutputDiabaticPopulation)
```

[Another example is available](@ref examples-tully-model-two) where we use FSSH and other
methods to reproduce some of the results from [Tully1990](@cite).

runtime = round(time() - start_time; digits=2)
