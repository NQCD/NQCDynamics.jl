# System-bath models




### Introduction
PS: Hoskeon wanna say something in this section Just something enlightening for the reader to understanding the genereal idea of system bath coupling.

When dealing with molecule-surface systems, wherein the surface is a metal or semi-conductor; the surface can be considered as an environmental bath that allows the dissipation of energy through coupling between the molecular "system" and the bath.

The effect that the bath has on the system is described by the bath spectral density, $J(\varepsilon)$, which can take various forms dependent on the method of energy coupling.

>This is specifically for Newns-Anderson (and WideBandBath), Spin Boson samples frequency and state coupling values from the discretised bath instead of electronic energies.
>$$
>J(\varepsilon) = \int_{a}^{b} d\varepsilon' \left| V(\varepsilon') \right|^{2} \delta(\varepsilon - \varepsilon') = \left| V(\varepsilon) \right|^{2}
>$$
>Where $V(\varepsilon)$ is the "coupling function" which describes how the bath and system should be related at a given energy.












## Newns-Anderson model

PS: Hokseon think we can briefly introduce the theory and link one or two of our papers for furtther reading for the interested reader. Bring more visitations/downloads to our papers!

### Spin-Boson model
PS: Hokseon not sure whether he is the best person to write this section


### Discretisation of bath 
talk something about why we need this. good for the IESH.

#### Discretisation with a gap
Hokseon'job
#### Your dicrestisation @mlarkin863

#### How to implement and develop your own discretisation
