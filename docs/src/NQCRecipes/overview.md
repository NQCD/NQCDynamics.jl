# NQCRecipes

[**NQCRecipes**](https://nqcd.github.io/NQCRecipes/) is an additional resource that provides a series of complex tutorials and workflows for NQCDynamics. 

All tutorials and workflows are presented in a Jupyter notebook format, including discussion around the models and methods presented. 

More will be added to NQCRecipes as more and more complex and interesting workflows are developed, and we are open to suggestions.
